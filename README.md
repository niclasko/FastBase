# FastBase
Data Convergence Engine

FastBase is a data convergence server for JDBC-enabled data sources. FastBase also has a built-in column store SQL database engine (called Fuse) where you can cache data sets. Additionally, FastBase allows you to run Javascript server-side and schedule those scripts to run periodically (for example to move data from a database to another).
